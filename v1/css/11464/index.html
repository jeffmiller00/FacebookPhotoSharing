			<p>I hereby grant to Pernod Ricard USA, LLC ("Pernod"), Aspen Marketing Services, Inc.

I acknowledge and agree that I have no right, title or interest, and agree that I will not claim any, in or to any of Pernod's trademarks, service marks, trade names or copyrights.</p>  
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>I shall have no right of approval, no claim to compensation and no claim (including, without limitation, claims based upon invasion of privacy, defamation, or right of publicity) arising out of any use or blurring, alteration, distortion, illusionary effect or use in any composite form.
			<br />I hereby release the Licensed Parties from any and all claims that I have or may have against them, whether for violation of any right of privacy, publicity, defamation, emotional distress or any other claim of any kind or reason in connection with any rights I am granting herein.  The provisions of this Consent and Release shall be binding upon me, my heirs and executors and the rights granted may be assigned to any person, firm, or corporation at Pernod's sole discretion.
